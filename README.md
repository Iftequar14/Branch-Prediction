Branch Prediction Project
Overview
This project focuses on the implementation and analysis of branch prediction techniques, specifically Pattern-based Predictor (PAp) and GAg Predictor. The goal is to evaluate the performance of these predictors and understand their impact on the efficiency of branch prediction in computer architectures.

Features
Pattern-based Predictor (PAp): Description of PAp predictor and its implementation details.
GAg Predictor: Overview and implementation details of GAg predictor.
Result Analysis: Comparative analysis of the performance of PAp and GAg predictors.
Interactive Visualization: Tools or scripts for visualizing and interpreting the results.
